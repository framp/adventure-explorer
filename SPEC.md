 - Wake up message
 - Generate random location type
 - Pick random message based on location type
 - Print files
 - Print directories
 - By default you can go to directories, open files, sorted by type
 - Going north means going one directory up
 - Going south means going down in the first directory
 - Going west means going in the first directory up and then the next directory
 - Going east means going in the first directory up and then the previous directory
 - Every new directory you generate a new location type for the directory and pick a random message for that type of location
 - If there are other directories there is a random signal message and you can go in any other directions
 - You can browse to /usr/bin or any other location in PATH and you will find a spells book
 - If you take it, you can run spells, as in commands in shell
 - Going to sleep brings you out of the game and saves the story
 - Time, skipping half a day at every change of location
 - go command should be invokable with directions

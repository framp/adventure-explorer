# adventure-explorer

Browsing your filesystem hasn't been this exciting since Microsoft's Bob!

Adventure Explorer lets you navigate the fantastic world hidden in your file system.

<INSERT AWESOME GIF WITH GAMEPLAY HERE - WHICH IS INEVITABLY TOO LONG>
 
## Run it
You'll need [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) because if you want to experience true adventure you shouldn't expect a binary.

```
stack build && stack exec adventure-explorer
```

## Features

 - Browse from one directory to another
 - _Try_ to open files
 - Find the awesome SpellBook️️™️ (somewhere in your `$PATH`)
 - Cast spells from any directory (if you found the SpellBook™️)
 - Sleep
 - Files auto-complete
 - Dynamic clock system which let you explore your filesystem at different times for unlimited replaying value*
 - Randomly picked descriptions based on your locations which stay the same across restarts
 - Immersive and definitely not distracting gameplay
